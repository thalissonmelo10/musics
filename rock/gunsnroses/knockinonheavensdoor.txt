Mama, take this badge from me
I can't use it anymore
It's getting dark, too dark to see
Feels like I'm knockin' on heaven's door

Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
Hey, hey, hey, hey, yeah

Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door

Mama, put my guns in the ground
I can't shoot them anymore
That cold black cloud is coming down
Feels like I'm knockin' on heaven's door

Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
Hey, hey, hey, hey, yeah

Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door

(You just better start sniffing
Your own rank subjugation, Jack
'Cause it's just you against
Your tattered libido
The bank and the mortician, forever, man
And it wouldn't be luck
If you could get out of life alive)

Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
Hey, hey, hey, hey, yeah
(Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door)

Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
(Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door)
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
(Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door)
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
(Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door)

Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
