I've been waiting for the tides to change
For the waves to send you my way
I see you darling but you pixilate
It gets hard to take these days

But we’ll hold the line, I won't let go
'Cause I’ll be there when you can finally make it home
And I don't mind
'Cause we both know
That we'll be fine when you can finally make it home

Because when I'm in a room with you that missing piece is found
You know when you're by my side, darling
Nothing can bring us down

I remember happy wastеd days
Summers golden haze in our еyes
Lifting you above the breaking waves
Memories floating back to my mind

You said hold the line, I won't let go
Cause I'll be there when you can finally make it home
And I don’t mind
’Cause we both know
That we'll be fine when you can finally make it home

Because when I'm in a room with you that missing piece is found
You know when you're by my side, darling
Nothing can bring us down
It's like when you're far away from me I get lost in the crowd
Because when I'm in a room with you that missing piece is found

I won't waste a minute when you're here
And we're finally in the clear
When every day is like the last
I just keeping holding fast

Because when I'm in a room with you that missing piece is found
You know when you're by my side, darling
Nothing can bring us down
It's like when you're far away from me I get lost in the crowd
Because when I'm in a room with you that missing piece is found
