Being a mistress on the side
It might not appeal to fools like you
Creeping around on the side
Might not be something you would do

But you haven't seen my man (man)
You haven't seen my man (man, man)
You haven't seen my man (man)
You haven't seen him

He's got the fire
And he walks with it
He's got the fire
And he talks with it

His Bonnie on the side, Bonnie on the side
Makes me a sad, sad girl
His money on the side, money on the side
Makes me a sad, sad girl

I'm a sad girl, I'm a sad girl
I'm a sad girl
I'm a sad girl, I'm a bad girl
I'm a bad girl

Being a bad bitch on the side
Might not appeal to fools like you
Creeping around while he gets high
It might not be something you would do

But you haven't seen my man (man)
You haven't seen my man (man, man)
You haven't seen my man (man)
You haven't seen him

He's got the fire
And he walks with it
He's got the fire
And he talks with it

His Bonnie on the side, Bonnie on the side
Makes me a sad, sad girl
His money on the side, money on the side
Makes me a sad, sad girl

I'm a sad girl, I'm a sad girl
I'm a sad girl
I'm a sad girl, I'm a bad girl
I'm a bad girl

Watch what you say to me
Careful who you're talking to
Watch what you say to me
Careful who you're talking to

I'm on fire, baby
I'm on fire

He's got the fire
And he walks with it
He's got the fire
And he talks with it

His Bonnie on the side, Bonnie on the side
Makes me a sad, sad girl
His money on the side, money on the side
Makes me a sad, sad girl

I'm a sad girl, I'm a sad girl
I'm a sad girl
I'm a sad girl, I'm a bad girl
I'm a bad girl

I'm a sad girl, I'm a sad girl
I'm a sad girl
I'm a sad girl, I'm a bad girl
I'm a bad girl
