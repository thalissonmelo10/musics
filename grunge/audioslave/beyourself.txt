Someone falls to pieces, sleeping all alone
Someone kills the pain
Spinning in the silence
She finally drifts away

Someone gets excited in a chapel-yard
And catches a bouquet
Another lays a dozen
White roses on a grave

Yeah
And to be yourself is all that you can do
Hey
To be yourself is all that you can do

Someone finds salvation in everyone
Another only pain
Someone tries to hide himself
Down inside himself he prays

Someone swears his true love
Until the end of time
Another runs away
Separate or united, healthy or insane

And to be yourself is all that you can do
(All that you can do)
To be yourself is all that you can do
(All that you can do)
To be yourself is all that you can do
(All that you can do)
To be yourself is all that you can do

And even when you've paid enough
Been pulled apart or been held up
Every single memory of the good or bad
Faces of love
Don't lose any sleep tonight
I'm sure everything will end up alright
You may win or lose
But to be yourself is all that you can do
Yeah
To be yourself is all that you can do

To be yourself is all that you can do
(All that you can do)
To be yourself is all that you can do
(All that you can do)
To be yourself is all that you can
Be yourself is all that you can
Be yourself is all that you can do
