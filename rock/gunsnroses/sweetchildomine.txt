She's got a smile that it seems to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky (sky, sky)
Now and then when I see her face
She takes me away to that special place
And if I stared too long, I'd probably break down and cry

Woah, oh, oh, sweet child of mine
Woah, oh, oh, oh, sweet love of mine

She's got eyes of the bluest skies
As if they thought of rain
I'd hate to look into those eyes and see an ounce of pain
Her hair reminds me of a warm, safe place
Where, as a child, I'd hide
And pray for the thunder and the rain to quietly pass me by

Woah, oh, oh, sweet child of mine
Woah-woah, oh, oh, oh, sweet love of mine
Woah, oh, oh, oh, sweet child of mine (ooh, yeah, yeah)
Ooh, sweet love of mine

Where do we go?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go?
Mm-mm, oh, where do we go?
Where do we go now?
Oh, where do we go now?
Where do we go?
Sweet child, where do we go now?

Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye (where do we go?)
Ooh, where do we go now?
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, woah, where do we go?
Oh-oh, where do we go now?
Oh, where do we go?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go?
Woah-oh, where do we go now?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Sweet child, sweet child of mine
